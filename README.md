HELP MACGYVER TO SCAPES

Openclassrooms P3 project

Coded in python with Pygame.


FEATURES

There is only one level. The structure (departure, location of the walls, arrival), must be recorded in a file for easy modification if necessary.

MacGyver is controlled by the arrow keys on the keyboard.

Objects are randomly assigned to the maze and will change locations if the user closes the game and raises.

MacGyver move from box to box, with 15 boxes on the length of the window!
He will retrieve an object simply by moving on it.

The program stops only if MacGyver has recovered all the objects and found the labyrinth output. If he does not have all the objects and he comes to the guard, he dies.
The program is standalone, that is to say it can be run on any computer
